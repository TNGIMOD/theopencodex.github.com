TheOpenCodex is a group that started on <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. Our mission is to make a large project, and the best part is, It's open source! Currently we are working on an HTML5-based side scrolling 2D adventure game. If you would like to contribute to any of the projects maintained by TheOpenCodex, submit a pull request on one of <a href="http://github.com/TheOpenCodex">our repos</a> on GitHub and join <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/groups/the-open-source-project">The group</a> on Codecademy.
